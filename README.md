# Print2Web

#### Info
You’ve successfully utilized web-based tools (Google suite) to design a multi-page print format of a “user manual”. Throughout this process you had to design and create against digital/web constraints while also using these tools as a print tool, versus a digital one. 

The designs that you produced with these apps are output as strict rules built into HTML, CSS, and some complex Javascript. This means that some of your decisions were pre-determined for you, versus the freedom enabled through “proper” design tools.

You are now tasked with reverse-engineering a selected layout from your user manual and designing it with code for the web. 

#### Project Themes
• Print to Web
• Reverse Engineering
• Tool Translation
• Designer to Engineer “Handoff”
• Browser Constraints
• HTML/CSS
• Responsiveness
				
#### Project Prompt
Using your selected layout as your “blueprint”, program a website that is a 1:1 replica of your design. Consider your job as the designer “over”; you’ve successfully created a static design that is now being handed off to a programmer (who is also you!) to implement it as a website. 

#### Questions
• Is it actually possible to translate 1:1 from design to code?
• How does the role of the programmer differ from the role of the designer in a creative context?
• Where does ownership begin and end in the website/software development process? 
• What is the true design artifact: the mockups, the code, or the website?
• Can you begin to notice the browser/design constraints that were baked into the web-based software you used?
• How is your design changing as you develop in code?

#### Goal
Throughout the process of building your website, take focus on building new skills and techniques in HTML and CSS. This is more of a technical project versus a creative one. Use these 4 weeks to explore and learn about the web development process; don’t worry about the creative output.

Most of your time will be spent on troubleshooting, debugging, and ultimately figuring out how to translate your design from static print to dynamic code. Google, forums, articles, YouTube, and each other will be your best friend. 

The goal is to build a 1:1 website based on your printed piece, but the challenge is understanding that this may not always be the reality working in code; make design decisions in the browser that will add to, not take away, the merit of your work. Design decisions at this point need to be made in the browser.

Coming out of this project, you should be confident in programming designed layouts and understanding how two-dimensional design translates to the web.
